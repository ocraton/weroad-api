Because it is between October and March that this land offers the spectacle of the Northern Lights, one of the most incredible and magical natural phenomena in the world, visible only near the earth's two magnetic poles. Come with us on WeRoad to explore this land of ice and fire, full of contrasts and natural variety, where the energy of waterfalls and geysers meets the peace of the fjords... And when the ribbons of light of the aurora borealis twinkle in the sky before our enchanted eyes, we will know that we have found what we were looking for."

We’ll then take a walk at the Dubai Mall, the biggest mall on the planet, and we’ll spend a night in the desert, with the sight of the skyline on the horizon keeping us company. Then, it will be Abu Dhabi’s tourn! Sheik Zayed’s Grand Mosque’s white marble awaits for us to remain stoked in front of its wonderfulness, and the sea will invade us with peacefulness. UAE are all to discover, we’ll just get a taste of it, but we guarantee you’ll get quite the idea!'

In this tour we’ll discover Dubai, where we’ll get on top of the highest skyscraper ever built, the Burj Khalifa. We’ll then take a walk at the Dubai Mall, the biggest mall on the planet, and we’ll spend a night in the desert, with the sight of the skyline on the horizon keeping us company. Then, it will be Abu Dhabi’s tourn! Sheik Zayed’s Grand Mosque’s white marble awaits for us to remain stoked in front of its wonderfulness, and the sea will invade us with peacefulness. UAE are all to discover, we’ll just get a taste of it, but we guarantee you’ll get quite the idea!'
